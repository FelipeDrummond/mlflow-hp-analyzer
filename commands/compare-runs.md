# Compare Runs

Compare the MLflow runs with IDs: $ARGUMENTS

For each run:
1. Get the run details including all parameters and metrics
2. If available, get metric history to compare learning curves

Provide a detailed comparison showing:
- Parameter differences between runs
- Metric differences
- Learning curve comparison (if history available)
- Hypothesis for why one run outperformed another
